# Areas for Growth:
Advanced TypeScript Typing: Youâ€™re already using basic TypeScript with interfaces (like FormDetails), but you could improve by adding more detailed typing (e.g., defining types for API responses, functions, and complex state objects).
Form Handling Enhancements: Consider using libraries like Formik or React Hook Form for more advanced form management, especially for larger forms with validation.
UI Improvements: You could enhance your UI by making the error modal or feedback more interactive, such as auto-closing after a few seconds or using animations for better user experience.
